# bench CLI

Bench is a command line tool that helps you install, setup, manage multiple sites and apps based on Frappe Framework.

---

## Usage

* Create a new bench

		bench init [bench-name]

* Add a site under current bench

		bench new-site [site-name]

	**Optional**: If the database for the site does not reside on localhost or listens on a custom port, you can use the flags `--db-host` to set a custom host and/or `--db-port` to set a custom port.

		bench new-site [site-name] --db-host [custom-db-host-ip] --db-port [custom-db-port]

* Add apps to bench

		bench get-app [app-name] [app-link]

* Install apps on a particular site

		bench --site [site-name] install-app [app-name]

* Start bench (only for development)

		bench start

* Show bench help

		bench --help

_Note:_ Apart from `bench init`, all other bench commands have to be run having the respective bench directory as the working directory. _(`bench update` may also be run, but it's behaviour is covered in depth in the docs)_

For more in depth information on commands and usage follow [here](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/master/docs/commands_and_usage.md). As for a consolidated list of bench commands, go through [this page](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/master/docs/bench_usage.md).

## Installation

To do this install, you must have basic information on how Linux works and should be able to use the command-line. bench will also create nginx and supervisor config files, setup backups and much more. If you are using on a VPS make sure it has >= 1Gb of RAM or has swap setup properly.

	git clone https://github.com/frappe/bench ~/.bench
	pip3 install --user -e ~/.bench

As bench is a python application, its installation really depends on `python` + `pip` + `git`. The Frappe Framework, however has various other system dependencies like `nodejs`, `yarn`, `redis` and a database system like `mariadb` or `postgres`. Go through the [installation requirements](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/master/docs/installation.md) for an updated list.

If you have questions, please ask them on the [forum](https://discuss.erpnext.com/c/bench) under the "Install / Update" category.

## Custom Bench Commands

Want to utilize a bench command you've added in your custom Frappe application? [This](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/master/docs/bench_custom_cmd.md) guide might be of some help.

# Easy Install Script

- This is an opinionated setup so it is best to setup on a blank server.
- Works on Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS 7+, Debian 8+
- You may have to install Python 3 and other essentials by running `apt-get install python3-minimal build-essential python3-setuptools`
- This script will install the pre-requisites, install bench and setup an ERPNext site `(site1.local under frappe-bench)`
- Passwords for Frappe Administrator and MariaDB (root) will be asked and saved under `~/passwoords.txt`
- MariaDB (root) password may be `password` on a fresh server
- You can then login as **Administrator** with the Administrator password
- The log file is saved under `/tmp/logs/install_bench.log` in case you run into any issues during the install.
- If you find any problems, post them on the forum: [https://discuss.erpnext.com](https://discuss.erpnext.com/c/bench) with the `installation_problem` under "Install / Update" category.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/playbooks/install.py
		python3 install.py --production

# Docker Install

1. For developer setup, you can also use the official [Frappe Docker](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker/).
2. The app, mariadb and redis run on individual containers.
3. This setup supports multi-tenancy and exposes the frappe-bench volume as a external storage.
4. For more details, [ead the instructions on the [Frappe Docker README](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker/)

Bench
=====

The bench allows you to setup Frappe / ERPNext apps on your local Linux (CentOS 6, Debian 7 or Ubuntu) machine or a production server. You can use the bench to serve multiple frappe sites.

To do this install, you must have basic information on how Linux works and should be able to use the command-line. If you are looking easier ways to get started and evaluate ERPNext, [download the Virtual Machine or take a free trial on ERPNext.com](https://erpnext.com/pricing).

If you have questions, please ask them on our [forum](https://discuss.erpnext.com/).

Installation
============

Easy Production Setup 
---------------------
> For production use and which also installs ERPNext. Supported for CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04+
> This is an opinionated setup with logging and SE Linux. So, it is best to setup on a blank server.

On Linux, open your Terminal and enter:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/install_scripts/setup_frappe.sh
sudo bash setup_frappe.sh --setup-production
```

On Mac OS X, open your Terminal and enter:

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/install_scripts/setup_frappe.sh" -o "setup_frappe.sh"
sudo bash setup_frappe.sh --setup-production
```

- This script will install the pre-requisites, install bench and setup an ERPNext site
- This will setup ERPNext with nginx, with Supervisor enabled and checkout the master branch of the ERPNext repo
- Passwords for Frappe, Frappe Administrator and MariaDB (root) will be generated
- You can then login as **Administrator** with the Administrator password printed 

If you want to develop ERPNext or any Frappe App, you can omit the "--setup-production" part from the command. This will setup ERPNext as well. Use ```bench start``` to run the server.

> Note: If you are using a DigitalOcean droplet or any other cloud provider's vps, make sure it has >= 1gb of ram or has swap setup properly.

Development Setup (Beta)
------------------------

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04+ and MacOS X. If you find any problems, post them on our forum: [https://discuss.erpnext.com](https://discuss.erpnext.com)

On Linux, open your Terminal and enter:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/playbooks/install.py
python install.py --develop
```

On Mac OS X, open your Terminal and enter:

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/playbooks/install.py" -o install.py
python install.py --develop
```

This script requires Python2.7+ installed on your machine. You need to run this with a user that is **not** `root`, but can `sudo`. If you don't have such a user, you can search the web for *How to add a new user in { your OS }* and *How to add an existing user to sudoers in { your OS }*. In addition, on Mac OS X, you will have to create a group with the same name as { your USER}. On creating this group, you have to assign {your USER} to it. You can do this by going to *"System preferences" -> "Users & Groups" -> "+" (as if you were adding new account) -> Under "New account" select "Group" -> Type in group name -> "Create group"*


This script will:

- Install pre-requisites like git and ansible
- Shallow clones this bench repository under `/usr/local/frappe/bench-repo`
- Runs the Ansible playbook 'playbooks/develop/install.yml', which:
	- Installs
		- MariaDB and its config
		- Redis
		- NodeJS
		- WKHTMLtoPDF with patched QT
	- Initializes a new Bench at `~/frappe/frappe-bench` with `frappe` framework already installed under `apps`.
	
You will have to manually create a new site (`bench new-site`) and get apps that you need (`bench get-app`, `bench install-app`).

Manual Install
--------------

Install pre-requisites,

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
* [WKHTMLtoPDF with patched QT](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) (required for pdf generation)

[Installing pre-requisites on OSX](https://github.com/frappe/bench/wiki/Installing-Bench-Pre-requisites-on-MacOSX)

Install bench as a *non root* user,

		git clone https://github.com/frappe/bench bench-repo
		sudo pip install -e bench-repo

Note: Please do not remove the bench directory the above commands will create

Initialize Bench using: `bench init frappe-bench`. Here you can replace `frappe-bench` with a name of your choice for your bench.


Installing ERPNext
------------------

If you're here to setup ERPNext, continue with [ERPNext setup](https://github.com/frappe/bench#setting-up-erpnext)


Migrating from existing installation
------------------------------------

If want to migrate from ERPNext version 3, follow the instructions here, https://github.com/frappe/bench/wiki/Migrating-from-ERPNext-version-3

If want to migrate from the old bench, follow the instructions here, https://github.com/frappe/bench/wiki/Migrating-from-old-bench


Basic Usage
===========

* Create a new bench

	The init command will create a bench directory with frappe framework
	installed. It will be setup for periodic backups and auto updates once
	a day.

		bench init frappe-bench && cd frappe-bench

* Add apps

	The get-app command gets and installs frappe apps. Examples include
	
	- [erpnext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext)
	- [erpnext_shopify](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext_shopify)
	- [paypal_integration](https://github.com/frappe/paypal_integration)
	
		bench get-app erpnext https://github.com/frappe/erpnext

* Add site

	Frappe apps are run by frappe sites and you will have to create at least one
	site. The new-site command allows you to do that.

		bench new-site site1.local

* Start bench

	To start using the bench, use the `bench start` command

		bench start

	To login to Frappe / ERPNext, open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`

	The default user name is "Administrator" and password is what you set when you created the new site.


Setting Up ERPNext
==================

To setup a bench that runs ERPNext, run the following commands

```
cd ~
bench init frappe-bench
cd frappe-bench
bench get-app erpnext https://github.com/frappe/erpnext			# Add ERPNext to your bench apps
bench new-site site1.local						# Create a new site
bench install-app erpnext						# Install ERPNext for the site
```

You can now either use `bench start` or setup the bench for production use.


Updating
========

To manually update the bench, run `bench update` to update all the apps, run
patches, build JS and CSS files and restart supervisor (if configured to).

You can also run the parts of the bench selectively.

`bench update --pull` will only pull changes in the apps

`bench update --patch` will only run database migrations in the apps

`bench update --build` will only build JS and CSS files for the bench

`bench update --bench` will only update the bench utility (this project)

Running the bench
==================

To run the bench,

*For development*: `bench start`

*For production*: Configure supervisor and nginx

To run the bench, a few services need to be running apart from the processes.

External services
-----------------

	* MariaDB (Datastore for frappe)
	* Redis (Queue for frappe background workers and caching)
	* nginx (for production deployment)
	* supervisor (for production deployment)

Frappe Processes
----------------

* WSGI Server

	* The WSGI server is responsible for responding to the HTTP requests to
	frappe. In development scenario (`bench serve` or `bench start`), the
	Werkzeug WSGI server is used and in production, gunicorn (automatically
	configured in supervisor) is used.

* Celery Worker Processes

	* The Celery worker processes execute background jobs in the Frappe system.
	These processes are automatically started when `bench start` is run and
	for production are configured in supervisor configuration.

* Celery Worker Beat Process

	* The Celery worker beat process schedules enqeueing of scheduled jobs in the
	Frappe system. This process is automatically started when `bench start` is
	run and for production are configured in supervisor configuration.


Production Deployment
=====================


You can setup the bench for production use by configuring two programs, Supervisor and nginx. 

> These steps are automated if you pass `--setup-production` to the easy install script 
> or run `sudo bench setup production`

Supervisor
----------

Supervisor makes sure that the process that power the Frappe system keep running
and it restarts them if they happen to crash. You can generate the required
configuration for supervisor using the command `bench setup supervisor`. The
configuration will be available in `config/supervisor.conf` directory. You can
then copy/link this file to the supervisor config directory and reload it for it to
take effect.

eg,

```
bench setup supervisor
sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf
```

Note: For CentOS 7, the extension should be `ini`, thus the command becomes
```
bench setup supervisor
sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frappe-bench.ini #for CentOS 7 only
```

The bench will also need to restart the processes managed by supervisor when you
update the apps. To automate this, you will have to setup sudoers using the
command, `sudo bench setup sudoers $(whoami)`.

Nginx
-----

Nginx is a web server and we use it to serve static files and proxy rest of the
requests to frappe. You can generate the required configuration for nginx using
the command `bench setup nginx`. The configuration will be available in
`config/nginx.conf` file. You can then copy/link this file to the nginx config
directory and reload it for it to take effect.

eg,

```
bench setup nginx
sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf
```

Note: When you restart nginx after the configuration change, it might fail if
you have another configuration with server block as default for port 80 (in most
cases for the nginx welcome page). You will have to disable this config.  Most
probable places for it to exist are `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` and
`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default`.
